# Functions in Javascript

In this tutorial you will learn about functions in javascript. Professional developers use functions all the time. They are a fundamental concept of coding in javascript (and most other languages). Take your time going trough this content to really get a firm graps on this concept, it will pay off.

### Structure of this tutorial
We will start by discussing a real life analogy of functions in order to illustrate what we want to accomplish. Next, we dive into what a function looks like and how you can use it in your code. In the third part we will look at the benefits of using functions. The final part goes into advanced usage of functions, consider this material a sneak peek of how modern javascript uses functions.

> _**This tutorial assumes you are familiar with the following concepts. If you feel unsure about any of these take some time to review the before continuing this tutorial.**_

> - _How to define and use variables_
> - _Built-in datatypes (Bools, numbers, strings, objects)_
> - _Boolean conditions, if-else statements_

## How to read a recipe
<a name="recipe"/>
We can think about programming as 'giving instructions', the special thing about programming is that our target for these instructions is a (dumb) machine. 
A different case of 'giving instructions' is found by looking at cooking recipes. 

In recipes the target is (intelligent) human. Although a human and a machine require very different instructions there are some similarities between instructions aimed at them.


Let us take a look at a simple recipe for making a fruit smoothie:
```
Step 1: Peel 2 bananas and mash them
Step 2: Peel 3 oranges, squeeze out the juice
Step 3: Clean and slice 10 strawberries
Step 4: Blend the banana mash, orange juice and the sliced strawberries together

Enjoy!
