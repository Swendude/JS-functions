Next we dive into what a function looks like and how you can use it in your code. Then we will examine how the usage of functions might benefit the code we write and develop. Finally we wrap up with an sneak peak at some advanced usages of functions to get you excited about the possibilities. Below that you will find a short summary of the contents that you can use to quickly review the material or to remind yourself of what you learned.

Most developers use functions on a day to day basis for their job. They are a fundamental concept of coding in javascript. Take your time going trough this content and put effort in building a model of what functions are and how they work.
